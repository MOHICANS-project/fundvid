Workflow: 

1) click on a bucket in the first image (you may keep clicking and changing the bucket)
2) press SPACE once you decide on what bucket to work, the bucked is now selected
3) in the small window with the zoomed bucked, click on 
 - 'f' to start selecting the required number of control points 
 - 'p' to select (as a polygon) in a rectangular bucket only the subarea which is visible in the other view 
 - 'd' - mark the bucket as entirely not visible (no points will be required for labeling it)
4) click on the corresponding bucket in the second image, and press SPACE when the corresponding point is clicked (a match notification will appear in the console)
